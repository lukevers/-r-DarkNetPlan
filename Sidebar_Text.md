**Terminology**, just to clear up a few misconceptions:

* **Darknet**: An anonymizing overlay network, usually running over the internet. Examples: [Tor](https://www.torproject.org), [i2p](http://www.i2p2.de/), [freenet](https://freenetproject.org/).

* **Meshnet**: A decentralized peer-to-peer network, with user-controlled physical links. Usually wireless. Examples: [Seattle Wireless](http://seattlewireless.net/), [Wireless.org.au](http://wireless.org.au/).

* **Clearnet**: The Internet at large, or any network which has no inherent cryptographic security, authenticity, or anonymity. Examples: internet, unencrypted meshnets.

* ***The* Meshnet**: Used here, "*the* meshnet" refers the transitional [CJDNS](https://wiki.projectmeshnet.org/Cjdns) internet overlay network currently known as [Hyperboria](https://wiki.projectmeshnet.org/Hyperboria).

* **/r/darknetplan**: A place to organize efforts to create a hardware/software stack for a globally scalable system of interconnected local meshnets. We realize that the inclusion of "darknet" in this name does not properly describe our current objectives, but the meshnet is a necessary foundation for the final goal of a truly resilient darknet.
